## Project Summary

We designed and developed a custom landing page for the *"Africa Everywhere: Identity, Art and the Spaces Between"* exhibition. The website serves as a digital showcase for your original works and fine art prints, and provides visitors with exhibition details and contact information.

The site is fully responsive and works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and all mobile devices.

## What's on the Website

- A full-screen hero introduction with the exhibition title
- Your artist statement ("Frame of Mind")
- Individual showcases for all four original works — Maikulu, Pink Boy, Pony Girl, and Resilience — with descriptions, dimensions, and pricing
- A scrolling gallery of additional artwork photography
- Fine art prints section with format options and framing service details
- Exhibition dates and venues (OXO Gallery, London & World Faze Art Practice, Accra)
- Contact section with Instagram, email, and phone

## Where the Website Lives

- **Live Website:** Hosted on AWS (link provided separately)
- **Code Repository:** Stored securely on GitHub

The site is live and publicly accessible with SSL (HTTPS) enabled, so the site is secure by default.

## Domain Name (Action Required)

To give your website a professional web address (e.g. kwabslartey.com), you will need to purchase a domain name. We recommend registering through Namecheap:

**Purchase your domain here:**
https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=Kwabslartey

Once purchased, share the domain details with us and we will connect it to your live website at no extra cost.

*Domain registration is a separate annual cost paid directly to Namecheap (typically $10–$15/year depending on the extension you choose).*
